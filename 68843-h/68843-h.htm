<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: Before the curtain rises upon Act <abbr title="1">I</abbr>, as soon as the
company has assembled, the Superintendent ostensibly begins a
short address of welcome. While thus engaged, “Beggar Maid”
enters at the rear of the room and immediately starts in with her
lines and by the time the First Mate, who up until that point has
been serving as an Usher, has made reply the whole audience is
conscious of the conversation taking place, and the dialogue goes
on uninterrupted until the end.</p>

<p>The transformation accomplished by the erstwhile Beggar
Maid, but now a Fairy Princess, is the sudden illumination of the
evergreen trees flanking both sides of the stage by colored electric
lights, and is very effective.</p>

and girls of the ....................... Sunday School.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Beggar Maid</span>: Oh, I’m sorry—not for them, but for myself—I
thought, if it was a movie you might let me in for this
ha’penny—it’s all the money I’ve got—But this is no place
for me—nobody wants a beggar around when they’re ’avin’
parties.</p>

<p class="stage">(Beggar Maid turns to leave, but before doing so the
usher takes her by the hand.)</p>

<p class="lines">(<span class="smcap">Usher</span>) First Mate: No, don’t go away—I assure you we shall
be glad to have you as our guest—Come with me.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Beggar Maid</span>: No, thank ’ee, I can’t come here wi’ on’y these

<p class="lines">(<span class="smcap">Usher</span>) First Mate: We have with us, Mr. Superintendent, an
unexpected guest—a stranger in town, who came here
thinking it was a movie show—I’ve been telling our young
friend that she will be welcome—but she is reluctant to accept
my invitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p class="lines">(<span class="smcap"><abbr title="Superintendent">Supt.</abbr></span>) Captain: You are quite right, Mr. ——, we are indeed
happy to have anyone come and share our joy—let
me assure you, dear, you are welcome—come right along,
see here we have a vacant chair where you will be able to
see the players, and, I dare say, you will find them quite
as fine as any you would see at the movies.</p>

<p class="stage">(By this time, with reluctant steps, led by the (<span class="smcap">Usher</span>)
First Mate, the Beggar Maid has come to the front of
the room and the center of the stage.)</p>

<p class="stage">(But instead of taking the proffered seat, turning to the
(Superintendent) Captain, and rising to her full stature,
she speaks.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Beggar Maid</span>: Mr. Superintendent, I am much pleased to find
here the Spirit of the Master, and to vouchsafe to you and
to all of these dear people gathered here, a royal, happy
good time in all your merrymaking, and in the homage I
trust each and all are now bringing in honor of the infant
Christ, who, two thousand years ago was born in a lowly
stable amid the hills of Bethlehem, in old Judea. No less
true is it in our day than it was of old that oftentimes we
entertain angels unaware. Doubtless, you think I am
only a beggar, and for that I am very thankful, for thus it
is possible for me to reward the kindly spirit you have
shown to those less fortunate than yourselves. But you
see I am not a beggar.</p>

<p class="stage">(Here the Beggar Maid drops off her outer garment.)
but a fairy princess, whose magic wand can make beauty
spring up everywhere.</p>

<p class="stage">(Turning to the right hand she waves her wand over
the trees, which instantly flash into beauty, (colored
lights), and then to the left hand—and, while the people
are rejoicing over the illumination, she rapidly runs
down the center aisle to rear of room, and makes her
escape, stopping only once to wish them</p>

<p class="pfs100"><span class="smcap">Street in Sandbach</span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: When the curtain rises Santa Claus is busy arranging
toys in shop window, lighting candles and doing such other
stage work as will enliven the scene.</p>

<p>No lines are spoken until Crispin and Maggie come upon the
scene, the idea being to portray the various types of folk one
would expect to find upon the street—the types can be many or
few, fishmongers, washwomen, laborers, children, musicians,
teamsters returning from work, street arabs, etc. Some of these
enter the shop and buy, others, like Crispin and Maggie, must be
content with looking in. These characters should enter alternately
from right and left stage.</p>

<p class="stage">(Enter Crispin.) Note: Boy enters right stage.</p>

<p class="stage">(Enter Maggie. After one-half minute girl follows, enters
left stage. They both walk slowly up stage to window
of the toy shop, keeping as far apart as is possible.
Both are interested only in the window display, and for
some time neither of them speak.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Hello!</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: (After pause) ’lo!</p>

<p class="stage">(Another silence)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: D’jer live ’ere?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: Naw.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Neither do I. (Pause). Wot’s yer name?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: Der gang calls me Cris, but in ’igh sasiety dey calls
me Crispin.</p>

<p class="stage">(After pause)</p>

<p class="midlines">Wot’s yore name?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: W’en I call on the queen my name is Maggie, but the
folk in our alley call me Mag.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: Wot yer hidin’ under yer apron?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: A apple.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: We’re d’jer swipe it?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: I didn’t swipe it, smarty, an old guv’ner gave it to me
for running an errand for ’im.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: Is that all ’e guv yer?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Isn’t that enough—wot yer want a guy to guv yer—a
sixpence fer doin’ nuthin’—an’ besides, he wor a nice ol’
gentleman.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: How d’jer know—was ’e a friend of yer feyther?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Naw, smarty, ’e was no friend of my fambly, I never
seen ’im before tonight—but I know ’e is a nice man—he
said such nice things to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: Wot d’jer mean by nice things—I never seed any on
’em knockin’ around our alley.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Well—w’en I got back to ’im he smiled and said,
“Thank yer, mi dear, and ’eres a apple fer yer, and I wish
yer a Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: (H)excuse me, Mag, fer takin’ liberties with yer name
on such a short acquaintance, but I ’ave to laff w’en I ’ear
of these rich guys wishin’ the likes of us a ’appy Christmas,
and doin’ nuthin’ to ’elp make their wish come true.—Now
if yer kind benefactor ’ad said, “Here’s a ten-pound
note—go and get yerself some warm clothes to cover
yer ’arf-naked body, and some food to fill yer empty stomach,
and get fer yerself one o’ them golden-’aired dollys
wot shut their eyes, and say, ‘Mamma’ when yer punch ’em
in their breadbasket,” I could feel he were sincere in his
good wishes for yer.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Now, Cris, yer mustn’t run on like that, it isn’t fair—some
of these rich folk never had the chances you and me
’ave ’ad—and so I say, clothes, or no clothes, food, or no
food, blue-eyed sleepin’, squawkin’ dollies, or no dollies,
I’m glad fer the progress some on ’em ’ave made. Perhaps
some day they will learn that true Christmas ’appiness
<em>begins</em> in <em>well wishing</em> and <em>ends</em> in <em>well doing</em>. Until then
we must be content in <em>lookin’</em> at the things which belong
to others, just as we ’ave been doin’ before this winder fer
the last ’arf ’our.</p>

<p class="stage">(At this point the clock in the steeple strikes five.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Crispin</span>: Gee, I must be going.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: So must I, Cris—but before we part I want to wish
yer a Merry Christmas.</p>

<p class="stage">(Both start to walk away in opposite directions, but before
leaving the stage Maggie stops.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: Say, Cris, just a minute—’ave yer a jack knife in yer
pocket?</p>

<p class="stage">(Cris searches his pockets—fishes out a rather dilapidated
knife—opens it, and hands it to Maggie, who
cuts apple in half—returns knife to Cris.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Maggie</span>: And ter make my wish come true, Cris—’er’s the ’alf
of my apple.</p>

<p class="stage">(Both leave the stage, joyfully eating the apple and
grinning from ear to ear.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Exit Maggie, Right.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Exit Crispin, Left.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Lamplighter. Enter right, lights street lamp and
exit left.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p class="stage">(Washerwoman. Enter left, carrying basket of wash.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Fishmonger. Enter right—Fresh herrin’, all alive, all
alive, all alive. Herrin’, fresh herrin’, twelve fer a shillin’.
Note: As she passes the shop of Santa Claus, Mrs.
Claus opens shop door.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Claus</span>: Are you sure yer herrin’ are fresh?</p>

<a id="corr2"></a><p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Fishmonger</span>: Mi lady, so ’elp me, they were swimmin’ in the
sea this very mornin’.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Claus</span>: Wot are yer askin’ fer ’em?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Fishmonger</span>: O’ny a shillin’ a dozen, lady.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Claus</span>: That’s wot I call dear for herrin’. Make it nine-pence
and I’ll take a dozen.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Fishmonger</span>: No, ma’am, not if I never sell ’em (walks away.)
Fresh herrin’, herrin’, herrin’, herrin’, all alive, all alive,
(suddenly turns again.) Well, missus, seeing as I on’y
have a few left, ’ere yer are, tak ’em at yer own price.
Counts out herring and exit.</p>

<p class="stage">(At this point Santa Claus locks up his shop for the
night, puts up shutters in front of windows and returns
into shop.)</p>

<a id="corr3"></a><p class="stage">(Musician. Enter right, carrying bass viol.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Night Watchman: Enter left, eight o’clock and all’s
well. Exit right. Note by this time the village streets
are nearly deserted.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Enter Ethel. Enter Harold. Immediately following
exit of Watchman after his 8 o’clock round, Harold and
Ethel enter from left stage—Harold is leading Ethel by
the hand. They look around from one side of the street
to the other, which at this time is deserted.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: I don’t believe Santa lives here.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: Neither do I—I expect he lives in a big house, like
the Earl of Crewe.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: I am beginning to think we shall not find Santa at all.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: Oh, yes, sis, we will find him—don’t get discouraged.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: But you are forgetting it is nearly time for him to start
out on his long journey.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: I have not forgotten that, but I am thinking that it
takes a big factory to hold all the toys Santa has made
since last year.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: Yes, but I don’t see any big factory here, do you?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: Look! Look! Ethel, I believe we have found it—see
that sign over the shop window, it says S. CLAUS,
TOYMAKER.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: Yes, and the shutters are up—that’s because Santa
doesn’t want anyone to see him at work.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: Let us go and knock on the door and see if Santa will
answer.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: No, I am a little bit afraid. You go.</p>

<p class="stage">(While the children are hesitating about what ought to
be done, Mr. S. Claus leaves the place and starts to
walk away rapidly. Just then, the children turn and
catch sight of him.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: See, Ethel, there he goes—Come, let us follow him.</p>

<p class="stage">(Both children leave the stage, shouting, “Santa, Santa,
wait a minute, please, Santa, wait.”)</p>

<p class="stage">(<i>Exit</i> Harold and Ethel.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Enter Towncrier from right stage.)</p>

<p class="stage">(First time off stage—Second time on stage—Crier
takes center stage, rings bell vigorously, takes position
with bell reposing in left arm, with right hand clutching
tongue of bell.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Town Crier</span>: Lost, strayed or stolen, a ten-year-old boy and his
young sister—the children of our fellow townsman, Mr.
Alphonso Cruickshank, Ironmonger and Tinker, of Number
12, High Street, Sandbach. When last seen, the children
were walking in the direction of Congleton Road, but beyond
this their whereabouts are unknown. A reward of
50 guineas in gold will be paid to any person, or persons,
who, finding the children, shall safely return them to their
bereaved parents.</p>

<p class="stage">(Exit Crier.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Watchman in distance is heard calling, “Nine o’clock
and all’s well.” The village clock strikes the hour and
the chimes sweetly play.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Enter Clews, right, who saunters across stage and returns,
taking position under lamp, when chimes are

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>: Harold and Ethel in their pursuit of Santa Claus,
the village Toymaker and Shop Keeper, find themselves far from
home and in the grounds immediately surrounding Brereton
Hall. The stage setting should consist of a hedge row built up
of small evergreen trees at the rear of the stage and on both
ends, with a wooden stile set in the hedge on right stage. Evergreen
branches are strewn around, left there by the hedger, who
had been trimming the hedges about the grounds.</p>

<p>The children enter from left and the Poachers, for such are
Clews and Allcock, who later appear, enter from the right, climb
over the stile and soon get busy at the task which brought them
there, namely, the bagging of a brace of rabbits for their Christmas
dinner.</p>

<p class="stage">(As the curtain rises, Harold and Ethel are wearily
dragging themselves across stage—when center is
reached, Ethel stops, and in tears she refuses to go any
further.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span> (tearfully): Harold, I just can’t go another step, I want
to go home to mamma.</p>

<a id="corr5"></a><p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: Don’t cry, Sis, you know I believe we’re almost
there—if you only think of the fun we will have when we
find Santa, you will forget all about being tired.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: I know it will be lots of fun to see Santa, and, if we
ever do find him, I’m going to ask him to show me all his
wonderful toys. But I think I’d rather wait until next
year. I want mamma.</p>

<a id="corr6"></a><p class="stage">(No longer able to restrain herself, she bursts out crying,
much to the undoing of Harold.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: See here, Sis, please don’t cry. When we get home
I’ll give you my new cricket bat and ball. Perhaps if we
sit down for a little while we will get rested. I’ll just
gather a few of these branches—that will be better than
sitting on the cold ground.</p>

<p class="stage">(Harold arranges the branches as a little bed down
stage, and places Ethel upon it.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: How lonely it is here at night. Can you see any houses
near?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: (Climbing up on stile so as to look over the hedge):</p>

<p class="midlines">Yes, I see a big house not far away. I’m sure that must
be where Santa is. Let us rest here awhile.</p>

<p class="stage">(Harold seats himself beside Ethel—puts his arms
around her, draws her near to him.)</p>

<p class="midlines">And then we will surely find Santa.</p>

<p class="stage">(After pause)</p>

<p class="midlines">I’m jolly glad the moon is shining, aren’t you, Ethel?</p>

<p class="stage">(Ethel does not answer, for she has fallen asleep. Gently
Harold lays her down upon the boughs and with a
yawn says——)</p>

<p class="midlines">I think I’ll just rest awhile myself.</p>

<p class="stage">(And in a minute he, too, is fast asleep.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Soon after the children fall asleep, two Poachers arrive
on the scene, and, entirely oblivious to the fact that
there are human beings near them, they proceed to the
work of the evening, just as the bell in the village clock
strikes the hour of ten. All through the work of the
Poachers the children remain fast asleep.)</p>

<p class="stage">(Just as the Poachers make ready to leave, the children
are discovered.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Clews</span>: Well. I’ll be blow’ed, if ’ere aint the babes in the wood.</p>

night—and what about the little gel, wake ’er h’up tew.</p>

<p class="stage">(After some time and much rubbing of eyes, the children
awaken.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: Please, Mr., can you tell us who lives in yonder house—Sis
and I hope that is where Santa lives. If so, we must
be going, or else Santa will have left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Ethel</span>: Yes, you know he will go just as soon as the clock
strikes twelve, and we want to see his wonderful toys before
he leaves.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Clews</span>: ’Earken to that, will yer, these kids want to see Santa
Claus—Ha! Ha! Ha! Say, Kiddie, there haint no Santa.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Harold</span>: You are mistaken, sir, for sis and I saw him tonight,
with our own eyes, but he walked so fast we couldn’t catch
up to him.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Allcock</span>: An’ w’ere might it be that yer saw the idol of yer

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Clews</span> (aside): Say, mate, it’s the owd codjer, S. Claus, the

spring up behind the hedge.)</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span> (addressing Imps): My mind is ill at ease—Go
where I will, I fail not to observe how men, in city,
town, and hamlet throughout the land, in fealty to Him
they call the Christ, are moved to deeds of mercy and of
love.</p>

<a id="corr7"></a><p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Imp No. 1</span>: If such be true, Your Majesty, it bodes ill of thee

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span>: Yea, such is true, and not content with that,
they move from street to street, and house to house, and,
like the angels on Bethlehem hills, two thousand years ago,
they proclaim the Messiah’s birth, and sing of <i>Peace</i> and
<i>Goodwill to Men</i>. Thus do they assail and threaten my
right to reign and rule.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Imp No. 1</span>: It must not be, Your Majesty.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span>: It shall not be—some way must be found to
stop these inroads upon my kingdom and domain—but
what to do, and how, and when, I know not.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Imp No. 1</span>: Has not Your Majesty thought of persecution?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span>: Persecution, in that ye counsel without knowledge.
To stop this tide of Christmas cheer by persecution
is as foolish as to attempt to dam a river at its mouth.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Imp No. 1</span>: Has not Your Majesty discovered any arch conspirator
in this plot?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span>: Aye, that I have and by cunning ways have I
sought to turn him from his course, but neither threat,
money, or persuasion have any effect upon him to check the
rising of good will, which, like water gushing from a fountain,
overflows and fills the hearts of the children of men
everywhere with his own genial spirit and warm friendliness.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Imp No. 1</span>: Where does he abide, Your Majesty?</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span>: He lives hard by an Inn, the Black Bear, where
incessantly he toils throughout the year in fashioning toys
and other gifts, which he lavishly bestows upon the people
in his journey around the world on Christmas night—but
I fear his real abode is in the hearts of men, and particularly
in the hearts of little children.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Imp No. 1</span> (rising and bowing): Pardon me, Sire for venturing
to suggest that thou commission us to wreak destruction
upon the toys, or otherwise prevent this arch enemy of
thine from carrying out his plan.</p>

<p class="lines"><span class="smcap">Lucifer Match</span>: Thou speakest words of wisdom, and it is my
will that thou perform in my name, and in behalf of my
kingdom this work of destruction. Here, then, is thy commission—Look
well to the task.</p>

<p class="lines">“Whereas, one Santa Claus, by cunning devices and by his unfailing
good humor and goodwill, is stealing the hearts and
fealty of my hitherto loyal subjects—now, therefore, do I,
Lucifer Match, declare that from this hour I will give him
no peace or rest—</p>

<p class="midlines">And, in order that his work may be brought to nought, I
do commission my loyal band of Imps to sally forth and
utterly destroy not only this arch conspirator, but all his

hour yet remains, and so I’ll improve it by taking a little
nap—How good it is after the day’s toil is ended to

labor. Here’s a cushion for my head, and what matters if
my feet hang o’er the end like culprits from the gallows.
